	<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>My Podd podcast application uses the Fetch API to pull podcast data and display it to the user for listening capabilities.</p>
	<p>A user is capable of selecting a show, followed by a season and selecting an episode from that season.</p>
	<p>A user is also capable of adding an episode of a show to their favourites allowing them to view them seperately and add and remove them as they please, along with being able to sort them alphabetically and by recently updated.</p>
	<p>Listening history as well as completed episodes are saved by the application and the user is able to reset all their history.</p>
	<p>A user is able to filter the shows on their dashboard alphabetically and by the most recently updated shows, a user is also able to filter their shows by genre and by using a searchbar.</p>
	<br>
	<p>For this project I used React and Vite with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to complete it, I decided to go with TypeScript due to its interface capabilities which helped a lot during data capturing and processing, I used Tailwind CSS for easier inline CSS and the ability for easier responsive design, my project is only responsive for desktop, but using Tailwind allows me change that if I were to want to.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Some of the challenges I faced during the completion of this project included learning TypeScript on the go as before this project I was only exposed to React and Vanilla JavaScript, other challenges included importing different components from Bootstrap and Framer-Motion, as the styling for these components weren't necessarily integrated into Tailwind CSS, so I had to figure out a way to combine both. State management with React also was quite difficult since TypeScript forces you to define state datatypes and so on, so learning the syntax was tedious.</p>

	<h2>Project Setup:</h2>
	<p>The Netlify link for the project is: https://poddpodcast.netlify.app/</p>
	<p>Furthermore, if you were to want to run it locally, simply download the project files and put them in a folder, whereafter you would have to run 'npm run dev' in that folder to run the project</p>
	<p>Note: Any images not displaying might be due to source destinations not being the same on different systems, be sure to update the source destinations. Any other issues might be due to insufficient resources found on local computer, if so, make sure to include React and other relevant services to your files or computer.</p>
